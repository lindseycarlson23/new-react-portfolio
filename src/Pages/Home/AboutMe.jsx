            Learning, thinking, and creating are my passions. My background is in music, academia, and HR/recruiting. I transitioned to web development through The University of Texas at Austin's Coding Bootcamp to explore a long-standing curiosity about programming and web development, and I have discovered a new way to apply these passions.
          </p>
          <p className="hero--section-description">
            My hobbies include playing French horn in a local orchestra, playing piano, reading, dancing, working out on my Peloton bike, and finding my center through yoga and meditation. I also greatly value my time with my family, friends, and two adorable dogs, and opportunities to give back to my community.
