      "description": "OBJECTIVE: Developed an AI-driven system for a (hypothetical) investment startup to analyze daily stock news and its impact on stock prices.\n\nDEVELOPMENT: Built a sentiment classifier by generating embeddings with a SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) and training a Random Forest model. Separately, used Llama-2 to generate weekly news summaries.\n\nRESULTS: The sentiment model achieved 68% accuracy and a 0.67 weighted F1-score on the test set, effectively distinguishing between positive, neutral, and negative news articles.\n\nIMPACT: Empowers financial analysts with actionable insights by providing real-time sentiment data and automated weekly summaries, leading to more informed investment decisions.",
