  # React Portfolio ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-purple.svg)
  
  ## Description
  
  This application was built by me to showcase my skills as a  web developer. For the basic structure and functionality, I followed the react tutorial, and then I added my own customizations and edits. The application is a single page React application deployed via Netlify. I added the form functionality, changed the footer, and added my resune link.I also tweaked the styling.
